This plugin requires that you install SIMBL http://www.culater.net/software/SIMBL/SIMBL.php.

To install the plugin, place it in "~/Library/Application Support/SIMBL/Plugins". create it if it doesn't already exist. You will need to install SIMBL as well. Right now it is only for Snow Leopard but there isn't anything major that is keeping it from working on Leopard other than some convenience methods.

It does not record audio at this time.

Works with the iPhone SDK 3.2 and 4.0. HD iPhone 4 and iPad recording not supported.
